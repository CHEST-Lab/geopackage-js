# GeoPackage Node
#### GeoPackage Node Library ####

The [GeoPackage Libraries](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/) were developed at the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)](http://www.nga.mil/) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](http://www.bit-sys.com/). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

### About ###

[GeoPackage Node](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-node) uses [GeoPackage Java](http://ngageoint.github.io/geopackage-java/) which is a [GeoPackage Library](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/) Java implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium [GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org/) [spec](http://www.geopackage.org/spec/).  It is listed as an [OGC GeoPackage Implementation](http://www.geopackage.org/#implementations_nga) by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

The GeoPackage Java library provides the ability to read, create, and edit GeoPackage files.

### Usage ###

    var GeoPackage = require('geopackage');

    // var newGeoPackage = '...';
    // var existingGeoPackage = '...';

    // Create a new GeoPackage
    var geoPackage = new GeoPackage();
    geoPackage.createAndOpenGeoPackageFile(newGeoPackage, function(geoPackage) {
      // file is created and open
    });

    // Open a GeoPackage
    var geoPackage = new GeoPackage();
    geoPackage.openGeoPackageFile(existingGeoPackage, function(err) {
      // file is open
    });

    // Feature and tile tables
    var featureTableNameArray = geoPackage.getFeatureTables();
    var tileTableNameArray = geoPackage.getTileTables();

    // Query Features
    geoPackage.iterateFeaturesFromTable(featureTable, function(err, feature, callback) {
      // feature is GeoJSON
      // call the callback when you are done processing the feature
      callback();
    });

    // Query Tiles
    geoPackage.getTileFromTable(tileTableName, z, x, y, function(err, tileStream) {
      // do something with the tileStream which is a png stream
    });
